        <h1>Part 01</h1>
        <h2>1. IxD documentation process: </h2>
         
         <div class="text-box">
            <h3>1.1.	Goal alignment:</h3>
            <p> My goal is to create a website that is easy to use and navigate. I want to make sure that the website is 
             accessible to all users, including those who may not be familiar with web design or technology. I want to create a 
             website that is visually appealing and easy to read. </p>
           <p>My goal was to make a website that is easy for people to use especially people experiencing the web for the first 
             time. I'll do this by displaying information about myself on the website that people can look through. I decided to 
             put my navigations at the top of the page similarly to the way Dropbox service (Dropbox.com, 2025) does theirs. 
             This is easy to see for new users especially if I keep the design consistent on all the pages. When styling I will 
             choose a colour that stands out to the users so that they will know this is the navigation bar. I will be using an 
             unordered tag for my navigation system. My visual hierarchy will prioritise my navigation bar. </p></div>
        <br/>
         
         <div class="text-box2">
            <h3>1.2.	Information structure:</h3>
            <p> My websites content will be structure as follows:
             Homepage: This page will have an avatar image of myself with a short about me text along side it. I will also 
             include an index section on this page to help direct users to specific information. </p>
             
         <p> Portfolio: The portfolio page 
             will have all my games for people to play. Entering a game page will take users to an about section of this game 
             and provide a link to the game's website on itch. </p>
      
         <p> Blogs: The blog pages will show all the discussion board assignments in the form of blogs. I want the viewers to 
             see how I went about designing the website and thinking about how media is interactive through my blogs. There 
             will be more navigation options that will direct the user to the blog week that they clicked on. This will also 
             act as my development log. </p>
      
         <p> Inspiration: The inspiration page will show picture and links of all the inspiration that I used for this 
             assignment. I was thinking of adding a mood board section for my style guide in on this page. </p>
      
         <p> Images: the images will just show all the planning drawing and diagrams that I made for the website. </p>
        <br/>
            <h3>1.2.1.	Information structure:</h3>
            <p> The information structure of my website is going to be a flat structure. This is because I want the user to be able 
             to navigate between the different pages easily without having to go through multiple pages. </p>
        <br/>
            <h3>1.2.2.Information structure diagram:</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Images/Spider Diagram.png" class="responsive-img" alt="This is a Spider diagram image which shows how the websites navigation system will work." width="500" height="300" />
            </figure>

            <h3>1.2.3. Information structure map:</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Images/Map.png" class="responsive-img" alt="This is a map of the website showing how the different pages are connected to each other." width="500" height="300" />
            </figure></div>
        
        <div class="text-box">
         <h3>1.3.	User flow:</h3>
            <p> Landing page: This will be the home page because it will show the user hoe the rest of the website will be set 
             up. </p>
      
         <p> Browsing: This will be directed in the form of my navigation bar. My Image page, inspiration page and my portfolio 
             page artwork section will offer users the browsing experience where they will just admire and critique my work and 
             design process. </p>
      
         <p> Engagement: This will be mainly the blog pages because users will be required to direct their attention to the 
             text. They will read all the different blogs that I have posted.</p></div>
         
        <div class="text-box2">
         <p><h3>1.4.	List and explanation of selected interface elements:</h3>
             Navigation bar: this bar is going to be fixed and constant on every page in my website. It is very easy to read 
             and gives the user visual feedback when they click or however on it. </p>
      
         <p> Cards: This will display a preview of the section you wan to go into. 
             Buttons: These will be square with visual feedback that lets the user know what they have done. </p></div>

         <p><h3>2.1. Design planning:</h3>
             At the moment I am using "h1" and "h2" for headings and subheadings. My paragraph body at the moment does not have 
             a selected font for the actual website. It's using the default font. The styling in terms of fonts will be 
             done in Css code later on. </p>
             
         <p> The colour palette that I will use when doing my styling is as follow
             Primary: #355C7D, #6C5B7B, #C06C84, F67280. </p>

      <h2>1.	Style Guides:</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
          	<p><h3>  1.1. Goal and aesthetics:</h3>
                 This website will have a somewhat green shade in terms of colour for my aesthetic. Then the text that we are 
                 using is going to have a digital semi-robotic feel to it. The reason I am doing this is because I am a game 
                 designer, so I want my website to reflect who I am through its font and colour schemes. If you have a look at 
                 my earlier design choices for my website colour schemes you will see that the colours are different to what I 
                 have decided to do now. I decided to use green shades because my avatar that is being displayed is green with 
                 a robotic feel. If you have a look at my itch page you will find a similar feel. I am going to be using my itch.io 
                 page as reference in terms of aesthetics. </p></div>

            <div class="text-box2">
            <p><h3>1.2.	Visual design elements:</h3>
                I've made my navigation bar more responsive and communitive to the user. I did this by adding and active component 
                to the button which will tell the user which page they are on. Then I've styled my navigation bar by using a 
                margin-right of 40px ad a float right so that it appears in a straight line at the top of the page. You will also 
                see that my images have a box shadow so that it stands out from the page. I found that my images with a white 
                background were still a bit harsh, so I decreased the opacity to 80% so that it's not painful to look at.</p></div>
    
            <div class="text-box">
            <p><h3>1.3.	Colour Swatches:</h3>

                  My wireframe for my design section is going to look the same as my wireframe for my blog page.
