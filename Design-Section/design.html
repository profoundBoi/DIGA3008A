        <h2>1. IxD documentation process: </h2>
         
         <div class="text-box">
            <h3>1.1.	Goal alignment:</h3>
            <p> My goal is to create a website that is easy to use and navigate. I want to make sure that the website is 
             accessible to all users, including those who may not be familiar with web design or technology. I want to create a 
             website that is visually appealing and easy to read. </p>
           <p>My goal was to make a website that is easy for people to use especially people experiencing the web for the first 
             time. I'll do this by displaying information about myself on the website that people can look through. I decided to 
             put my navigations at the top of the page similarly to the way Dropbox service (Dropbox.com, 2025) does theirs. 
             This is easy to see for new users especially if I keep the design consistent on all the pages. When styling I will 
             choose a colour that stands out to the users so that they will know this is the navigation bar. I will be using an 
             unordered tag for my navigation system. My visual hierarchy will prioritise my navigation bar. </p></div>
        <p>
         
         <div class="text-box2">
            <h3>1.2.	Information structure:</h3>
            <p> My websites content will be structure as follows:
             Homepage: This page will have an avatar image of myself with a short about me text along side it. I will also 
             include an index section on this page to help direct users to specific information. </p>
             
         <p> Portfolio: The portfolio page 
             will have all my games for people to play. Entering a game page will take users to an about section of this game 
             and provide a link to the game's website on itch. </p>
      
         <p> Blogs: The blog pages will show all the discussion board assignments in the form of blogs. I want the viewers to 
             see how I went about designing the website and thinking about how media is interactive through my blogs. There 
             will be more navigation options that will direct the user to the blog week that they clicked on. This will also 
             act as my development log. </p>
      
         <p> Inspiration: The inspiration page will show picture and links of all the inspiration that I used for this 
             assignment. I was thinking of adding a mood board section for my style guide in on this page. </p>
      
         <p> Images: the images will just show all the planning drawing and diagrams that I made for the website. </p>
        <p>
            <h3>1.2.1.	Information structure:</h3>
            <p> The information structure of my website is going to be a flat structure. This is because I want the user to be able 
             to navigate between the different pages easily without having to go through multiple pages. </p>
        <p>
            <h3>1.2.2.Information structure diagram:</h3>

        <div class="text-box">
         <h3>1.3.	User flow:</h3>
            <p> Landing page: This will be the home page because it will show the user hoe the rest of the website will be set 
             up. </p>
      
         <p> Browsing: This will be directed in the form of my navigation bar. My Image page, inspiration page and my portfolio 
             page artwork section will offer users the browsing experience where they will just admire and critique my work and 
             design process. </p>
      
         <p> Engagement: This will be mainly the blog pages because users will be required to direct their attention to the 
             text. They will read all the different blogs that I have posted.</p></div>
         
        <div class="text-box2">
         <p><h3>1.4.	List and explanation of selected interface elements:</h3>
             Navigation bar: this bar is going to be fixed and constant on every page in my website. It is very easy to read 
             and gives the user visual feedback when they click or however on it. </p>
      
         <p> Cards: This will display a preview of the section you wan to go into. 
             Buttons: These will be square with visual feedback that lets the user know what they have done. </p></div>

      <h1>Part 02</h1>
     
      
      <h2>1.	Style Guides:</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
          	<p><h3>  1.1. Goal and aesthetics:</h3>
                This website will have a green shade in terms of colour for my aesthetic. Then the text that we are using is going 
                to have a digital semi-robotic feel to it. The reason I am doing this is because I am a game designer, so I want my 
                website to reflect who I am through its font and colour schemes. If you have a look at my earlier design choices for 
                my website colour schemes you will see that the colours are different to what I have decided to do now. I decided to 
                use green shades because my avatar that is being displayed is green with a robotic feel. If you have a look at my 
                itch page you will find a similar feel. I am going to be using my itch.io page as reference in terms of aesthetics.
                Originally, I wanted my website to have very minimal details so that the user is not over stimulated when looking at 
                my website. I now found myself adding a little bit more to my aesthetic because I found that the aesthetic I had was
                underwhelming when compared to the tech game feel that I was trying to create.
                 </p></div>

            <div class="text-box2">
            <p><h3>1.2.	Visual design elements:</h3>
                <ul>Navigation -
                    </p>
                   <li> My original design for navigation in my wireframe took up the entire nav section at the top of my website. 
                    While styling my navigation bar I realised that this design did not compliment my aesthetic choices in terms
                     of colours and fonts. It did not have a tech game feel to it hence I decided to change it to something more 
                     suitable. The new navigation design pushes all my nav links to the far right and stacks them next to each 
                     other from there. I want to try and keep my navigation as close to the right-hand margin as possible.
                     Additionally, I added a dynamic background to the navigation text to help the user identify which section 
                     of my website they are on. </li>
                    </p>
                    <li>At the start of my html section of this website I designed my blogs to be navigated by using a navigation bar. 
                    This was not suitable for that way I wanted my user to switch between my blogs. Using a nav element prevented 
                    me from styling my blog navigation as a card. There might be a way to do it by using navigation however I 
                    haven't figured it out. As an alternative I decided to just add the href link to a class called blog-card. 
                    This class would store only that specific week's information and link. This allowed me to create the card 
                    style that I wanted to have. I also positioned the cards in rows so that the blog weeks flow into the next 
                    one. I added a background image to the blog cards when the user hovers over it. This communicated to the 
                    user which card week they are currently exploring. A read more text which is my actual link to the different 
                    blogs has been added to the bottom of each card. Its at the bottom of each card so that if the user decides 
                    that they would like to explore my discussions for the topic on the blog card. The read more text also changes 
                    colour once the user hovers over it so that they know they can click it.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    Text shadows -
                    </p>
                   <li> I added text shadows to the text that where directly above the background image that I put it. This was done 
                    because the text above my background images where hard to read without some sort of contrast between them. It 
                    took me a while to get the text shadow to look the way I wanted it to look. It made some of my text look blurry 
                    which was hard to read so I add a hard line surrounding the text.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                  Containers and container backgrounds - 
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    To establish content hierarchy and improve visual clarity, I enclosed major content sections within containers 
                    that use semi-transparent dark green backgrounds. These transparent overlays allow the user to see the 
                    background image while still clearly distinguishing between different content areas. Initially, I experimented 
                    with lighter green tones for these containers, but they lacked contrast with my white text and made the content 
                    hard to read. The darker tone not only complements the rest of the palette but also ensures accessibility and 
                    readability. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                   Web Icon -
                   </p>
                   <li>
                    A favicon has been added to every page of the site. While small, this detail enhances the sense of 
                    professionalism and reinforces brand identity. It also makes it easier for users to locate the site tab when 
                    multiple browser tabs are open.
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    Colour usage -
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        I tried to use a different colour for my nav and my background at first. My nave started off using a green 
                        shade that was lighter than the background colour for my body. I then changed the body background to an 
                        actual image which was lighter than my nav bar. I found that this brought more life to the website, and it 
                        was more inviting for people. 
                        The colour palette has changes slightly. I used the colour swatches shown in 1.3 as a basis to find the 
                        actual shades of green that best suited my website. Initially I thought that my colour watches in 1.3 were 
                        going to be my final selection but as I designed my website and saw how these colours looked in my website 
                        I decided to alter them to best suit the aesthetic that I was going for.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
            </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="text-box">
            <p><h3>1.3.	Colour Swatches:</h3>
                <ul>
                    Primary - Dark pastel green
                    <p>
                        Hex - #739c71
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        This was the main colour that I wanted my website to have because it has a soft, elegant tone which, on its
                        own, created a calm and clean look. This soon changes along with my visual identity now being gamified and 
                        tech based. I then changed this tone to a darker and more saturated tone. I found that this added contrast 
                        and appeared to be visually more dominant for my navigation bars and my footers. It had more weight to the 
                        website as seen in typical game dashboards and home pages, their navigation is often heavy depending on the 
                        style of game being played and designed.</p> 
                        New hex - #334e2e
                    </p>       
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    Hover - Light pastel green
                    <p>

                        </figure>
                        This was originally a soft pastel green, I replaced it with a more vibrant green. This shade offers 
                        stronger contrast against dark backgrounds and is now used in hover effects, boarders and highlights. It 
                        gives clear visual feedback to users, aligning with UI patterns commonly found in digital interfaces and 
                        games. </p>
                        New Hex - #d3f20a and  #517b25
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hex - #8e9b8f

                        </figure>
                        This colour was intended to be my background colour but things changed one I found a suitable image for my
                        background. I found a new place for this colour in my container bakground. I didn't like the transparency 
                        that this colour had so I changed it to a darker darker green variant that was also transparent.</p>
                        New Hex - #08230489

                        I wanted this to be the colour for all my text. This did not go well with the overall green tones on my website.
                        Instead I decided to use a white colour for my text. I found that this was more suitable for readability.

                        For my headings, I chose the “Tektur” font. This style has a digital, angular appearance that immediately 
                        create a feel of sci-fi or tech-inspired aesthetic, which aligns closely with my website's focus on game 
                        design and development. The sharp geometry of the font adds personality and makes the headers visually 
                        distinct from the rest of the content. It helps to establish a visual hierarchy, drawing attention to key 
                        titles and section names.</p>

                        For my body text I used the “Open Sans” font. This font is known for its legibility and clean lines, 
                        making it an excellent choice for seperating information from the headings.
