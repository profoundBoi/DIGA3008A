        <h2>My experience with setting up GitHub</h2>
        <p>Setting up my GitHub was arguable the easiest part about getting started, mostly because my GitHub had already been set 
            up from last year. However, if we look back at my very first experience when setting up GitHub, I would say that it is 
            fairly easy to understand because the website has clear directions. It is important to note that my experience with 
            digital media as whole has also assisted me in setting up my GitHub. The challenging part came in when I had to link me 
            GitHub to my visual studio code, this was because it was my first time interacting with the linking system in visual 
            studio. I found myself referring to the lecture slide to guide me on this set up.</p>
        <p>
   
         <h2>Reflection on the readings </h2>
         <p>The first reading I looked at was by Berners-Lee 1994 The world wide web. In this reading I saw a statement that said, 
            “If you haven't yet experienced the web, the best way to find out about it is to try it” (Berners Lee, 1994, p.76). 
            I found this to be a valid statement as my experience with the web only improved through constant usage of the web. 
            This is because as I used the web more, I became more familiar with the navigation system. In 1999 the voice browser 
            was introduced to the web as shown in the w3 timeline (W3.org, 2025). I found myself using the voice browser several 
            times, such searching for a songs name. If a song was playing on a radio and I needed the name of the song I would use 
            my voice browser to detect the songs origins. The last reading that I looked at was the story of flash. In this 
            reading it spoke about trends and how trends come and go in the software world (Jay, 2017). In my time exploring the 
            web I have indeed noticed this as there has been many web browsers created in my time ranging from fire fox to Chrome 
            and much more. The survival of these webs can arguable be based on its efficiency to gaining information. This may 
            result in more users using that type of web, increasing it's popularity. </p>
        <p>
         <h2>Interesting things about the history of the web</h2>
         <p>The most interesting thing that I found out about the history of the web is the actual timeline that shows the history 
            of the web. I did not know that technology had its roots planted as early as 1944/1945. This was news to me. I also 
            enjoyed exploring this timeline further and seeing how the web developed overtime. This made me thing about the future 
            of the web and where it could end up. It's interesting having this information because it inspires one to want to be a 
            part of these developments.  </p>
         
            <p>
         <h2>My Goals from this course</h2>
         <p>My goal from this course is to become a multi versatile developer in game design and media type such as webs, 
            applications and much more. I hope that this course will help me develop my critical and creative thinking skills so 
            that I can contribute to my goals in a meaningful way. </p>
