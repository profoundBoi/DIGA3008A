                <h2>Christoph Lutz's 2019 reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    The reading that I have decided to reflect on is a Christoph Lutz's 2019 article about the dived and inequalities in the 
                    digital age of artificial intelligence. This text aims to explore how these digital divides affects and to what degree and 
                    at what level they affect us depending on how access and knowledge about the digital age. In this reflection I am going to 
                    explore the content of this articles by looking at Lutz's ideas and link them to my own critical framework in the digital 
                    age being in digital arts where I work in games, websites, and researching. I will do this by reflection by first 
                    interpreting the text to how I understand it by talking about the levels of digital divide, then I take a more personal 
                    approach and link the conversations to my own experiences.

                    The argument separates its points in first, second and third level of digital divide and explains how each of these divide's 
                    work. The first level of the digital divide it the limitations to having access to the digital space. The reason why I think 
                    that this is the first level is because this is where the user is introduced to the digital space, which can be through 
                    devices such as phones. Later, the ability to use the device or digital technology will affect the user but that we will 
                    discuss in the second digital divide. Lutz talks about how the in access to digital technology has demonstrated inequalities 
                    through how it works in terms of functionality and if this device is available to you either financially or just set up near 
                    you will access allowed such as a library with computer for visitors to use. The second level of the digital divide talks 
                    about one's skill level and literacy in technology affects how they use the device effectively. The article is saying that 
                    one can have the device but not the know how on how to use the device for what it was meant for. Moving on to the third 
                    level of the digital divide, we talk about the outcomes of these devises. This talks about how users with better and more 
                    experience gain more from these devises either financially or just social benefits. This has been shown a lot on social 
                    media where people who make content with good video quality and a solid video edit with have a higher advantage than the 
                    people with lower quality phones and so on.

                    In terms of what I do the digital space is what run my work. I mainly focus on game design and web development and to do 
                    these things I need to be knowable and skilful in all levels of the digital divide. I need to have access to a good computer 
                    and have the skills to use the game engines combined with coding I order to make games. lastly the type of product that I 
                    produce will determined if I get a job after university or not which is the social benefit of the third digital divide. 
                    However aside from the practical work I need to do background

                    Christoph Lutz's article effectively sheds light on how digital divides are not simply about access, but about deeper issues 
                    of skill, opportunity, and outcome in the digital age. Reflecting on his framework through the lens of my own work in 
                    digital arts, I've come to recognise how each level of the divide influences both who gets to participate and who benefits 
                    from digital technology. Whether it's gaining access to reliable tools, developing the technical literacy needed for 
                    creation, or using those tools to gain social and professional advantage, the impact of these divides is evident in my own 
                    experience as a game designer and web developer. This reflection has deepened my understanding of the inequalities built 
                    into digital spaces and emphasised the importance of not only building digital skills but also advocating for more easy and 
                    equal access and outcomes within the creative industries.
