            <h1>Blog Week 4: Website design & IxD Process</h1>
    </section>

    <article>
            <h2>Website Design:</h2>
            <p>I have currently been working on my website though its html section since this is what is due on the 17 March 2025. 
                In this section I focused on how my user is going to be navigating the different pages of my website. Some of my 
                blogs had images between paragraphs so I couldn't just copy and paste it. My home page will have buttons leading to 
                my portfolio, blog, inspiration, images pages. Each one of these pages listed will have a Home Button taking users 
                back to the homepage. It will also have buttons to navigate to other pages that the user is not in, e.g. a blog page 
                button in my portfolio page.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Images/Spider Diagram.png" alt="This is a Spider diagram image which shows how the websites 
                          navigation system will work." width="500" height="300" />
            </figure>

            <h2>IxD Process:</h2>
            <p>1.	Flow of website navigation:
                The flow of my website feels smooth. It doesn't feel like anything is out of place. My blogs are in the correct 
                place so if a user's clicks on a blog button they will be directed to the blog pages. </p>

            <p>2.	Visual communication and its consistency:
                I place all my buttons at the top of the page so that the user knows that this is the navigation. I kept this 
                style consistent in all my pages to prevent users from getting confused with how my navigation works. My pictures 
                also have descriptions to them so that they user can see what this images are about. It also helps in case the 
                image does not load on the website. </p>
            
            <p>3.	Website responsiveness:
                My website buttons work so far. I had 404 errors in the beginning, but I managed to fix them. Having working 
                buttons help the overall feel of the website's responsiveness. The website is also not slow. This is because I 
                don't have aspects that require a lot of power to view, along with the help of decent internet connection. </p>

            <h2>Reflection:</h2>
            <p>The main thing that I struggled with while building my html section of my website was understanding how html worked. 
                This did not take long to overcome. After learning how to use html for this section of my website the next issue was 
                my GitHub. My GitHub was working in terms of pushing and pulling however it didn't not allow me to view my website 
                from the GitHub link, I have been using live view before this. Eventually we figured out how to view my website 
                from GitHub which showed me errors that I did not know where there. For example, my navigation did not work in my 
                GitHub link even though it was working on my live view. This problem was solved using a “dot dot” to call folder 
                inside of another folder. </p>

            <p>
                I am happy with where the website is now. This is mainly because it feels like something that's usable in terms of 
                gaining information about this assignment. Users will read my blogs and see what I've been working on so far for 
                this website. The picture also adds some context to how I planned my wire fames for this website. I do need to add 
                some of my other design drawing to the website under images. This page will be more like a mood page for the 
                website. The mood page will consist of all my planning drawing. I'm still deciding if I want this page to look 
                like a collage or not. </p>
