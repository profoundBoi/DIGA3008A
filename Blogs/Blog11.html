             <p>
                By approaching justice and ethics both as an artist and as a programmer would require me to be aware of how my design affect 
                people’s live and if it does this in a good or in a bad way. I would have to be very mindful and create design that are fair to 
                everyone instead of trying to just avoid offending people. The very beginning of any design should start from an ethical point 
                of view. 
             </p>
             <p>
            <p>
                In my designs it is important create with responsibility to people and to have a community led practice as stated by Sasha 
                Costanza-Chock (2020) This means that the only way to create designs which are fair and respectful is to have the community 
                involved in the development process because these designs are going to affect the community.  We should not be trying to solve 
                peoples’ problems but rather work with people to create the best solution. As designer we do not know everyone’s struggle, but 
                it does not mean that we can’t work with people to find out what these struggles are. In terms of programming, I would need to 
                work with a community to create games and websites that are accessible to them. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
                One way that we can do this is to resist biases that have often been assumed by previous developers which harmed communities. 
                The way we can avoid these biases is by including people oversight in our projects to get more honest and ethical reviews and 
                feedback. This prevents us as developers and artists from assuming what people want and need. This also build a more transparent 
                system because now people know exactly what they are getting. We can also include more transparency by having our design and 
                systems operate in a transparent way instead of trying to mislead the users.
