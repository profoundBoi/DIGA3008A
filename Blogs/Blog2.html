            <h2>Reflection on Moulthrop, S. (2003) reading:</h2>
         <p>The text examines the pros and cons while talking about the development of the hypertext. I am going to examine this 
           text on hypertext while linking it to modern day internet and how we interact with it. The hypertext offers the 
           connections for researchers to find information text (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 693). In modern day internet a lot of people 
           use the hypertext for many things such as research, or just for personal use. Many university students use the 
           hypertext for project that they are working on. They would then add links to these websites in their research so that 
           people reading their work can find the original peace of information. The origin of hypertext has evolved so much that 
           we even use it as media, and which include graphics and videos. Not only do we have text being linked to other text, 
           but we also now have text being linked to images on the webs. The internet as we know it today is basically built 
           around some form of hypertext because we use this to navigate the web as well. </p>
        <br>
         <h2>Folder structure and the URL scheme:</h2>
         <p>For this project I don't want to make something that's too complicated even for me to understand as I am still a 
            beginner. I want to explore a user-friendly design for people that are completely new to the web. Hence, I will just 
            keep it simple with a homepage, blog page, portfolio page, inspiration page, and images page. </p>
