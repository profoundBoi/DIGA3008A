                <h2>Amidst a pandemic by Kasapis 2020 </h2>
                <p>
                    The reading internet access is a fundamental right especially, amidst a pandemic by Kasapis in 2020 talks about how it has 
                    been shown and proven that people need to have access to the internet in order to actively take part in basic society which 
                    is why the internet needs to be a human basic right. The article is trying to make people aware of the disadvantages and 
                    human rights violations that have been going on since the pandemic which resulted in a lack of internet access for a large 
                    number of people. It does this by bringing up topics which address how we use the internet for education, work, economy, 
                    healthcare, and freedom and how all these things contribute to making a human happy which is a human right. This get the 
                    reader thinking about how they are living their own life and weather or not they are happy. By doing this the reader is 
                    putting themselves in the position of a human who does not have access to internet and how it would affect them.
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>
                    The article uses the coronavirus pandemic as evidence to support the claim that internet is a basic human right. We see this 
                    as the article begins to talk about how education during lockdown had to take place online which required internet access 
                    and stable Wi-Fi. For some students this worked well but for other student they were heavily disadvantaged in their 
                    education either because of not having the equipment to participate in online learning or because they did not have the 
                    necessary internet access required to run online learning. This is a valid argument as show in the high fail rate that the 
                    pandemic produced in South Africa as shown by the department of education in 2020 and 2021. Some people would be ignorant 
                    enough to claim that that the high fail rate was due to student not taking their education seriously during this time 
                    because of a lack of supervision but the reality is that student did not have the equipment and Wi-fi connection for the 
                    internet to work during this time, which deprived many students of their right to basic education. The article then also 
                    addresses the working conditions during the pandemic being online known as remote work. The people who did not have internet 
                    access during this time could not participate in remote work options which meant that they could not earn money to support 
                    their families. This divide was arguably one of the toughest divides during the pandemic because money was the seen to be 
                    the most important part of surviving the pandemic because it was used for purchasing food and medication to aid people who 
                    got the virus. It is important to note that some companies made provision for their employees to have internet access in 
                    order to continue their work from home. When we look at how the article address healthcare in relation to the internet, we 
                    see that it the lack of internet has prevented people from receiving information about the virus and how to stay safe as 
                    well as prevented people from booking vaccination appointments. The meant that people did not have access to basic health 
                    provided by the government because they could not register for vaccinations which would help fight the virus if they were to 
                    catch it later in life. Although there are some debates about the vaccination being good for you or not it is still medical 
                    assistance made free for people to access but because internet was an obstacle in obtaining this medical treatment peoples 
                    health rights have been violated. We can see that all of these limitations can lead to one feeling unhappy which as stated 
                    earlier in the article is a human right to feel happy. 
                </p>

                    Freedom of expression is another basic human right, and the internet is a platform that offers one the ability to comment on 
                    political and other issues of the world similar to what we are doing in the article analyses. The article talks about having 
                    access to information because of the internet and without it we are being silenced which is also a right violation. This 
                    article acts as information to us reading it which allows us to freely express our opinions on the internet being a right. 
                    There are people who don't have access to this type of articles because of a lack of internet which essentially prevents 
                    them from realising that they are lacking basic human rights, silencing underprivileged communities.

                <p>
                    By using the pandemic as an example and evidence to state the articles claim makes the strengthens the seriousness of the 
                    situation and how important it is to have internet access because it forces people to think about their situations during 
                    the pandemic. This is effective in creating afferences. The article chose a topic that most people can relate.  
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I agree with the articles argument and claim that having access to internet is a basic human right. This is mainly 
                    due to the shift that the world is going through where the internet plays huge part in our day to day lives to the point 
                    where it has even become second nature. The internet has proven to be able to help people developed their education even 
                    outside of school by researching other people past experiences and development. This has been proven through YouTube which 
                    is a very large platform where information and skill tutorials are shared. I've also thought about how often I rely on the 
                    internet to complete my daily tasks which include educational purposes and health purposes. Recently I made a doctors 
                    appointment but online, which saved me the time of having to go to the venue to make the appointment.
