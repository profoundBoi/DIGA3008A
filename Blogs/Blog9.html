                <h2>Decolonialism in the digital space</h2>
                <p>
                    In the digital space and a coding context, decolonialism means designing a system that is inclusive to as many people as 
                    possible especially people who come from less privileged communities and inequalities. Example of these are designing 
                    websites that can be accessed by phones which are budget friendly instead of focusing on designing something only for hight 
                    end phones. At times I feel like I have focused on designing systems that are meant to mainly work on high end devices such 
                    as I phones, Samsung's, and gaming laptops. I feel like this is because of what I have been exposed to growing up, where I 
                    was always told that the only way I could access a certain game was on a gaming pc or when I needed to do an application 
                    online it was always better to use a laptop because of how it was scaled. This influenced my thinking because I assumed that 
                    these things could only work on these high-end platforms and devices. In my own coding practice and UI design, I've become 
                    more aware of how default frameworks and design systems often reflect colonial and western perspectives. This can be through 
                    languages used, images, or assumptions about user behaviour such as whether or not my user will understand the function 
                    selected sematic markup which I used to design elements like navigation in my website. For example, when choosing fonts, 
                    icons, or even layout logic, I now try to ask myself does this design accommodate users with different reading directions, 
                    languages, or cultural norms and am I reinforcing a default that might not represent the people who will use this site? I 
                    also will try and adopt this in game design. Most gamers especially in south Africa don't use a consol or laptop, they use 
                    mobile devices such as phones. I will try to design game for phones that users can download and play. I am assuming they 
                    user can get a decent Wi-Fi connection just for the download process, but the game will not require internet to play.

                    When adding java script to my website I had to critically analyse my website components to see where Java script could be 
                    added effectively. I first took a look at navigations. I wanted the navigation from blog to blog to be buttons with the 
                    words next on it. This indicates to my user that they can read the next blog this way instead of having to go out of the 
                    current blog week page. Then I looked at interactivity for my website. I decided to make my image folder a gallery that user 
                    could flip through by enlarging the images with java script. The user would enlarge the small image by clicking on the image 
                    using java script and navigating the images from there. I might change the text on my buttons from “next” to an arrow to 
                    suit different language type. A symbol might be easier to understand compared to a language that my user might not know. 
                    This is one way I will incorporate decolonialism in my website.
