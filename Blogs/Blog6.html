            <h2 itemprop="headline">Digital Equality: An Interview with Nanjira Sambuli - World Economic Forum (2019) </h2>
            <P>
                The first reading that I am engaging with in this blog post is the reading by Nanjira Sambuli where they discuss how achieving 
                digital equality is layers of complexity and isn't as simple as we think. Nanjira states that simply giving people access to the 
                internet isn.t enough and what really matter is how meaningful each person interaction is with the internet (World Economic 
                Forum, 2019). Simple using basic connections as the main measure of progress isn't enough, instead we must consider contextual 
                factors such as gender, language, and local power within our society and cultures. It is clear that This point resonates 
                strongly with design justice frameworks. This is because a lot of the time in design and especially digital product design, we 
                tend to prioritise scale over specific details of our consumers. If we look at other sources that strengthen this argument we 
                can look at GSMA 2022, women in Sub-Saharan Africa are still 37% less likely than men to use mobile internet today. We can take 
                from this that design which is fair involves redistributing not just access.
            </P>

            <h2 itemprop="headline">Internet Access is a Fundamental Right - Kasapis (2020)</h2>
            <p>
                In this reading by Kasapis, it is argued that internet access should be seen as a human right and not just a luxury as the world 
                be live in today is constantly growing around this digital space. Kasapis states that those without access are excluded from 
                important opportunities in our society such as education, healthcare, and employment. With regards to education, we have seen 
                this massive divide first hand during the covid-19 pandemic when schools had to be moved online. This disadvantaged more than 
                half the country in South Africa. This does challenge the way we design these systems in future as it makes us reconsider the 
                ethical implications of the platforms we create. Hence the way forward it keeps access in mind when developing technologies and 
                create systems where people without access to these technologies can then be granted access either through libraries or 
                communities. </p>
            <p>
            <h2 itemprop="headline">Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                These two reading both challenge surface-level approaches to digital inclusion and in an ethical way as well. We need to start 
                asking questions like how people are going to use and connect with these systems and not just privilege communities but also 
                less privileged communities. I have learnt from these reading that I as a designer need to start look forward in my design
                 access to people, and meaningful along with safe access as the standard.
