      <p>  Blog Week 3: User alignment and interface elements</p>

            <h2>User Alignment:</h2>
        <p>The user alignment that I hope to build in this website is an introduction to the web for users that completely new to 
            how the web works. To do this this I will need to find simple ways to design my UI so that users can read it clearly. 
            I want my users to be able to read both the text on my website and the design. I want my users to be able to navigate 
            between my homepage, portfolio page, image page, and blog page. They should be able to see the navigation bar at the 
            top of each web page.</p>
        <p>
         <h2>Map out of sites content:</h2>
         <p>The first page that the user will see and interact with is the homepage. From the homepage the user can then navigate 
            to the other section on the website such as the blogs page, portfolio, images. The most important part of the website 
            is the homepage as it determines how the user can expect to interact with the rest of the website. Then the most 
            interesting thing that my website would have it the portfolio section. I want to try adding a way for the user to 
            interact with my games on the website.</p>
        <P>
         <h2>Experience:</h2>
         <p>The user will first read the home page. This will have a bio and an image representing me. When they navigate to the 
            blog page, they will be able to read my weekly blogs including this one. The readings will we quite long, so I don't 
            expect users to read all of it. Each blog will have a navigation button taking the user to the full page where they 
            can read that blog. Moving on to the portfolio page, I want this to allow the user to experience an online exhibition 
            with interactive components on the page. </p>
        <p>
         <h2>Interface elements:</h2>
         <p><li>Input controls - I will use buttons to navigate different pages in my website. Then I will add a dropdown list that 
            will manage the navigation of my blogs. </li>
            <li>Navigation components - I will use icons to help the user identify the different pages on the web.</li>
            <li>Informational components - I will use a message box to inform the user about what each page is about. </li>
       
        <p>
         <h2>Reflection:</h2>
         <p>This week I felt like I made a lot of progress. Mainly because I am starting to understand how html works when 
            designing my website. Drawing up the wire frames has also helped me understand what I want my website to be like by 
            the end of the semester. I do acknowledge that some of the things I would like to attempt to make might be out of my 
            reach in terms of knowledge, but I'll try my best to accomplish it. </p>
