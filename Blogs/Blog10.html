            <h2 itemprop="headline">What is ethical internet</h2>
            <p>
                When thinking about ethics in general we often think of right and wrong, good from bad, and unspoken rules that people in 
                society follow. How do we then determine what this looks like on the internet, an ethical internet. To me this is a digital 
                space where rules, rights, and dignity are expected to be respected by the people using and participating in this digital 
                space.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
                When diving into the main themes around ethical internet we look at data and datasets. One would think that the user should have 
                full control over their personal information, but the reality is that we don't know what happens to our information the minute 
                we put it out on the internet, where it goes and how it is used. I believe that platforms on the internet need to build privacy 
                from the very beginning instead of making it a last-minute development. When looking at how sage the internet is today, we need 
                to rely on ethical practice to make the internet safe. what we see online is curated by algorithms that prioritise engagement at 
                the cost of truth or safety which is why companies like Meta and YouTube should be more forthcoming about how content is shown 
                and distributed to its users daily. It is easy for harmless information to get caught in these algorithms such as racism, 
                sexism, and other forms of discrimination. Most of these actions are done for the purpose of harassing other user on the 
                internet which goes against ethical practices in everyday society outside of the internet as well. Next, we look at how easily 
                information can be misleading just like during the covid 19 pandemic which highlighted the ethical responsibility of platforms 
                to limit the spread of false information. We see misinformation as a public threat that requires coordinated responses from 
                governments, platforms, and users alike (Wardle and Derakhshan, 2017)
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, an ethical internet is not just a technological ideal buy it's a reflection of society values and rules. It is a 
                space where power is distributed fairly, users are treated as people and not products, and technology serves humanity, not the 
                other way around. To build it we need to noy only build better policies and designs, but also a collective shift in how we think 
                about rights, responsibilities, and relationships in the digital age.
