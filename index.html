      <p>Setting up GitHub</p>
      <p>Setting up my GitHub was arguable the easiest part about getting started, mostly because my GitHub had already been set up from last year. However,
         if we look back at my very first experience when setting up GitHub, I would say that it is fairly easy to understand because the website has clear directions.
         It is important to note that my experience with digital media as whole has also assisted me in setting up my GitHub.
         The challenging part came in when I had to link me GitHub to my visual studio code, this was because it was my first time interacting with
          the linking system in visual studio. I found myself referring to the lecture slide to guid me on this set up.  </p>
