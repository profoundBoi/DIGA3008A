  Hello world 
  testing again

  Seting up GitHub
  Setting up my GitHub was arguable the easiest part about getting started, mostly because my GitHub had already been set up from last year.
  However if we look back at my very firt experiance when setting up GitHub I would say that it is fairly easy to understand because the website has clear directions.
  It is important to note that my experiance with digital media as whole has also assited me in setting up my GitHub. The challenging part came in when I had to link my 
  GitHub to my visual studio code, this was because it was my first time interacting with the linking system in visual studio. I found myself referring back to the 
  lecture slide to guid me on this set up.
