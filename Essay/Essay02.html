              <h2 itemprop="headline">The internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h2>
              <p>
                The internet as we know it today is not just a digital tool, but it is one of many sources which host interactivity and 
                arguments for a geopolitical space. The most powerful and famous ideologies and cultures thrive in this space particularly 
                Western culture which to some extent could be using subtle forms of digital propaganda to push agendas. These agendas have led 
                to exploitation of weaker communities and nations as seen in the google maps and the Gulf of Mexico renaming dispute, also known 
                as digital coloniality. This essay is going to critically reflect on the intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and 
                digital coloniality by discussing geopolitics and the internet, google maps and the Gulf of Mexico, digital coloniality and 
                power structures, and lastly conclude all our findings. 
              </p>

                Geopolitics and the internet are not neutral to the rest of the world but rather favours the systems and governments who have 
                the most power, influence and money. A platform like Google which host political borders in the digital has the power to 
                determine how different countries, states and place are represented on the internet. They are the only ones with power to 
                changes names and labels on the internet which represent these places.  This is called being a geopolitical actor as they have 
                the tools and resources to change political structure. These tools are prone to steering in the direction of biases of 
                information because they do not just determine the information that we know but also determine the agency we have with this 
                information and what we are able to know (Graham, 2014, pp. 100-101). This makes us question if the information that we gain 
                from the internet is ethical and right. Although there are ways, we can determine the validity of geopolitical information such 
                as actual country names and names of places which exist outside of the internets geopolitical space. For example, the case study 
                that we are using Gulf of Mexico still exist as Gulf of Mexico outside of the internet however geopolitics is trying to colonise 
                the name by changing it to Gulf of America. Some people would not even come across this type of information at first unless they 
                actively search it because internet companies like google determine what you see and when. This is dues to the personalisation 
                of results where different content for different users is practiced and produced (Ballatore, 2017, pp. 1196). We have seen 
                similar practices in applications like Instagram and TikTok where the algorithm decides what users are interested based on what 
                they liked previously on the platform. This prevents user from coming across other information such as political changes and 
                shifts around the world. Therefore, we can conclude that geopolitics and the internet is indeed not neutral firstly because they 
                have the power to change political states without full agreement such at the Gulf of Mexico incident and because it does not 
                provide everyone with the same information all the time and prefers to give different information types to different people.

                The Gulf of Mexico renaming demonstrated colonial activity in the digital space by both internet companies and governments. 
                This historical event now meant that the Gulf of Mexico would now be known as the Gulf of America is much more than just a 
                renaming but also a display of power inn the political internet world. It is also to be noted that this change will only be 
                changed for internet users in the United States of America (Goodwin, 2025). This also show us that although the president Donal 
                Trump has the power to change the name of Gulf of Mexico in America, he does not have the full power to determine what the place 
                is called in other countries of the world. This could potentially spark conflict between the United States allies if Trump 
                request that they follow his attempt at renaming The Gulf of Mexico. If the allies agree to this, it will only further 
                strengthen the power of the United States. The Mexican government and people where not happy with this decision for valid 
                reasons, they argued that the Law of the Sea dictates that an individual country's sovereign territory only extends up to 
                12 nautical miles out from the coastline (Gerken, 2025). This meant that any land and territory extending 22.2 kilometres 
                outside of Mexico’s cost belonged to Mexico and that the United States changing this the name of this property which belonged 
                to Mexico would be breaking this law. The Mexican president, Sheinbaum, responded to Trump and Googles decision by bantering 
                around the idea of renaming Northan America to Mexico America. If the Mexico request for this renaming and it is denied it 
                will spark controversy on the internet but most importantly it will demonstrate power differences between the United States 
                and Mexico. Mexico’s political image will be seen as inferior to that of Donald Trump and the United States. On twitter we have 
                seen a mixture of responses where some people are either for or against this decision. A tweet from Eric Schwartz stated that 
                he thinks the renaming Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America is going to “catch on” just like when Twitter was renamed 
                X (X (formerly Twitter), 2025). The comedian is not saying whether he is for or against this decision, but this statement does 
                however imply that he thinks the United States has so much power that people with just start forgetting about the original name 
                having Mexico in it. This could be seen as history altering as America is taking a piece of Mexico’s history away with the 
                change of a name. Therefore, by going against laws and regulation for one’s own benefit, image and power the renaming of the 
                Gulf of Mexico in the United States has proven to be colonial practices in the digital space which could potentially result in 
                I fight for the actual land itself.

                Digital coloniality is determined by whoever has the most power, fame and influence in the political world. This shouldn’t be 
                the case, but it is and why do we allow it to happen. The people making these decisions the same people who citizens vote for 
                to have this kind of power. The companies that have the power to make these decisions are also in favour of the west. This 
                results in something called technocolinalsm where our main source of digital information and advertising, about 82%, comes from 
                companies like google and Facebook which are all western based companies (Verdi, 2020, p. 3). We can request for name of places 
                to be made on the platforms, but they are the ones who commit the action of naming places. Most often the information that we 
                are exposed to are Western information from these platforms. Local news only appears if one actively follows channels which 
                promote local news or if one searches about it, but it never just appears on the algorithm the way western news does. This 
                unfair display of information show just how far digital coloniality extends as not only do they determine what information 
                they push out, but they are also the most dominant spread of information around the world. It is also important to note that 
                this makes it easy for western propaganda to be spread and faster which is why some people also think that the renaming of the 
                Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America will catch on. Therefore, companies like google and Facebook have the most dominance when 
                it comes to the spread of information globally which will result in then having the monopoly in this field and the power to 
                push digital coloniality.

                The digital ecosystem of Google allowed for this the information about the Gulf of Mexico renaming to reach worldwide news. 
                This however does not mean that everyone saw the news when it was published. The digital ecosystem allows for information to 
                be spread at a very fast pace due factors like internet connection and communities. The communities that exist in this 
                ecosystem are the communities formed by people who use platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. It is also 
                important to note that the people in power of these ecosystems are mainly male dominant which brings up a conversation for 
                further inequalities in the digital world. If we link this the president of Mexico, Sheinbaum, where she requested that 
                google not to go ahead with the United States request and being denied. Could this be because google doesn’t take her serious 
                because she is a woman despite being a president? This brings to light additional layers of digital inequality, including 
                gendered power dynamics playing a role in digital coloniality and geopolitics. This makes it clear that more feminists are 
                need in, on and around the digital internet space to challenge the ideologies of technologies (Magenya.S, 2020). This will 
                also help create a more power feminist influence in the digital ecosystems. Therefore, because of the nature and the ecosystem 
                thriving on human interaction and communities it allows for information to be spread around the world at any time.

                We can conclude from this essay the way the intent, geopolitics and digital coloniality intersect and interact reveal a 
                very unequal power dynamic. We’ve seen this in the Gulf of Mexico renaming where is goes beyond territory and land dispute and 
                becomes a display of power. The question of gender even enters the conversation where we a space which doesn’t represent woman 
                as much as it represents men. Platforms like google which are very dominant assert control over representation and narrative in 
                ways that marginalise less powerful countries, people, places and voices. This clear shows what digital coloniality is about 
                and we have seen it in many cases favour western ideologies like the United States of America. Therefore, we can conclude that 
                the internet is an extremely deeply political space which allows for those who control it to shape and determine global 
                representations.
