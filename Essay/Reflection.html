            <p>
                The creation of this website has not only developed my creative thinking but also my structural thinking. I am going to reflect 
                on the challenges and process that I had faced to help me get the website to where I needed it to be. This will be done by 
                reflecting on my folder structure, semantic markup, metadata, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            </p>

                The folder structure that I started out with was extremely messy and did not have any structure. The reason why I think the 
                folder structure started off messy was because my main focus at the time was learning how to use html and getting my website 
                ready for assignment one. This made me neglect the way my folders should have been organised. The was extremely visible in my 
                image folder because it just had loose images inside which were not labelled correctly. As the assignment went on, I need to 
                find the same image it was hard to identify which image was the one I was looking for because I numbered my images 1 to 5 and 
                so on. I decided to give my images more descriptive names and section them off into categorised folders within my image folder. 
                For example, all my wireframes are in a wireframe folder inside my image folder. I also then started creating more descriptive 
                folder for my html, CSS and JavaScript. All my code for JavaScript was in a JavaScript folder just like my CSS. This was when 
                referencing one of these scrips I just needed to look in the respective folder. I had to also change my folder naming convention 
                because it had space inside of them and this was not correct practice. I decided to either add a dash to separate then or make 
                the second word start in a capital letter without space between the first and second word. I feel like overtime my folder 
                structure has developed into a well readable hierarchy.

                When I started this assignment, I was very mindful of my semantic markup and thought that I was doing the right thing until I 
                received feedback where it became clear to me that there were a few things I was doing wrong. I was not using semantic markup 
                such as main header and so on. This was the first thing I decided to tackle in my website because at the time it was most 
                    important. Currently I have used fundamental semantic tags such as header, nav, main, section, and footer to 
                        establish a clear structure. I’ve notice that this provides the browser and assistive technologies with a better 
                        understanding of how content is organised. This also helped me when it came to styling because everything was organised 
                        and not randomly coded in html. I have correctly implemented my links and my buttons where I used button and a tags.
                             In my website the use of semantic markup has allowed me to make my website easy to use in navigation which it what
                              I wanted my website to feel and be like from the beginning. I feel like my semantic markup can improve 
                              accessibility in my website in my responsiveness of the website. Maybe by having specific semantic markup for 
                              mobile devices instead of reusing the current semantic markup. This is something that I might try in the future 
                              and see how it reacts and whether it makes the website more accessible.

                Looking at my metadata I feel like I have included sufficient metadata to guide my user. I made sure to include some basic 
                metadata elements such as title which gives information about what each page is about on my website. I’ve also added meta 
                    name with descriptions which I use to go more in depth about each page and what the user will be experiencing on each 
                    page. I made sure to include metadata suitable for each blog page which describes what that specific blog page is talking 
                    about. I do think that I would make the website more readable by search engines if I added structured data such as 
                    schema.org. Overall, I’m happy with the way I’ve setup my metadata considering that this was my first website that I 
                    have attempted to make without any prior knowledge on html, CSS and JavaScript.

               My CSS started off well. The only think that I really noticed when designing my CSS is that I shouldn’t have use in line styling 
               in my html. I also made sure that they are styling for my mobile device adaption is working well. I felt like I did a good job at 
               getting my scalability to look proportional. I didn’t find making the responsive difficult, it was basically restyling but for a 
               smaller screen. The video lectures did help me a lot with understanding how to scale and style for a mobile device. Every time I
                add something to my website, I always make sure that the scaling is responsive for mobile devices and devices with smaller 
                screen sizes.

                The implementation of JavaScript was the most difficult part about the website. First, I needed to decide which areas needed 
                JavaScript or find ways to introduce JavaScript so that it fits with my websites flow.  I decided that the best way for me to 
                use JavaScript was for button clicks and content selection and loading. I did make use of DOM in my website as well. I Added 
                an Api which updates my website users about different game news which have released. I’m getting my game news from RAWG. The 
                implementation of the Api was one the most difficult part about coding in JavaScript because I wasn’t sure how to get the news 
                to constantly update. Moving onto my scroll up button. This was the easiest part about JavaScript because it didn’t require any 
                linking to external websites and links but instead focused on the page it was on. I also have a prompt generator in my home 
                page. This prompt generator looks at the different prompts I provided in code and gives it to the user. After this the user 
                will be required to explore that specific section in my website.

                In conclusion my website displays decent code and structure for a beginner but there are things that I need to work on 
                such better preparation in my semantic markup, so I don’t have to go back and fix it. I also feel like I need to work on 
                some of my user experience. An example of this is my essay and blogs. I don’t really like the background behind the text,
                but I added it there to make the text more readable. Overall, I feel like I did a good job creating this website.
