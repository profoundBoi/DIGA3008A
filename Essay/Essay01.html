        <h2 itemprop="headline">Gandi.Net Website Analysis</h2>
        <p>The Gandi.net website is a French website that offers services in South Africa and is mainly known for providing domain registrations 
            and web hosting services. Although web hosting and domain registration are their main services, you can also find other offers and 
            tools which can protect and manage website presence online. The reason why I decided to do this website is firstly because it offers 
            its services in South Africa, it has an elegant design which I like, its operation is based around websites which will be 
            interesting to look at how they approach interactivity on their website, and lastly, I would like to expand my design knowledge by 
            analysing a website which hopefully practices ethical interactive web development. This essay will analyse how the websites design 
            its user interface, what is the user experience of the website is, is the website using ethics of interactive design, and lastly 
            conclude all our finding of this analysis in order to find out the importance of how web interactions are structured through user 
            interface and user experience.</p>
        <p>
        <P>The user interface on the Gandi.net website is designed in such a way that it not only communicates to the users where they are, but 
            it also guides the user intuitively on how to use and navigate through the website. This can be visual responsiveness that the 
            website offers when a user interacts with or hovers over a navigation button at the top of the screen. While hovering over a 
            navigation button at the top of the screen, we see that a dropdown pops up with more information about the website that the user can 
            navigate through. This is a good way of guiding the user through the website. On the Gandi.net website, there is a drop-down arrow 
            button which tells the user that there is information that can be accessed in that area. The user interface should also be enjoyable 
            for the user by creating an immersive and personalised experience (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2016). This statement in 
            relation to the Gandi.net website has allowed us to take a step back and evaluate the interface on a personal level. Although this 
            may not be the best way to analyse a website, because everyone prefers different things. For example, if we look at the colour 
            choices for the Gandi.net website, it is very minimal, and some people might like a very colourful website. The website uses a 
            pastel colour palette that we can see on all the pages. Some pages have a full colour background to communicate which section of the 
            website they are in. When the user moves to a different page on the website, the colour will also change. This will help the user 
            identify that they should expect to engage with a different topic and section of the website. We can also see that the website has 
            used fonts very strategically. This is seen in the two types of fonts shown on the website, one simple and readable font, while the 
            other has a little more style and design to it. The simple font has been used in the navigation of the website, which makes it 
            easier for the user to read. Because the navigation of the website is one of the most important parts of the website, as this is 
            what the user uses to explore your website, it is essential that it is legible. The more stylised font has been used for headings 
            and subheadings on the different pages. This is kept consistent throughout the website, which won’t confuse the user as they use the 
            website. Therefore, the user interface uses icon such ass drops down icons, colours, and fonts to help the user navigate the website 
            and understand what they need to do in certain sections on the website.</P>
        <p>
        <p>User experience plays a vital role in how users interact with your website, which is something that the Gandi.net website does 
            extremely well. The website does not bombard the user with too many options when they open it, which creates a welcoming feeling for 
            the user. Users often want to feel like the website that they are using respects them and values the time and effort it takes to 
            collaborate in using a website (Husseniy, Abdellatif and Nakhil, 2021, p.27). The Gandi.net website makes it feels like they respect 
            the users’ eyes and ability to process information at a given time by not overwhelming them with a lot of information from the 
            start. Instead, the website offers the user a chance to explore the website by having a general heading which could contain certain 
            information. We see that the website offers an interaction in the form of a search bar on the home page. This search bar allows 
            users to check if the domain name that they are interested in using is available. I’ve also accessed this website on my mobile 
            phone, and the scaling has been adjusted appropriately so that people without large screens and interact with the website. There is 
            also a burger button, which was added to the responsive version of the website. Switching between the different pages on the website 
            does not have delays, it feels instant. This creates a feeling of efficiency, which also reflects on the company’s work ethic. 
            The website also uses the footer extremely well, as it acts as a direct index where users can find different website information by 
            clicking on the buttons. By doing this, the user feels included in the design as the website considered that they might miss 
            important information that the user was looking for, so they added in the footer. The footer is also the last thing that the user 
            usually sees because it is at the bottom of the page, so adding a lot of information here won’t negatively affect the users’ 
            experience of this website. Therefore, we can conclude from this user interface analysis that the Gandi.net website’s user 
            experience keeps its users in my and respects its users as it provides a clear and calm experience that communicates well without 
            overwhelming the users with information.</p>
        <p>
        <p>Creating a user experience is one thing, but creating a user experience that is ethical and does not violate your users’ rights and 
            culture is something that always needs to be considered for a good website. When it comes to privacy on digital platforms, this gets 
            overlooked a lot and becomes concerning because of how fast and wide the digital world has grown (Uxmatters.com, 2021). 
            The Gandi.net website has taken privacy very seriously in their website, as it is even one of the options and services that they 
            offer users, such as having a domain name for a secure online space. This is clearly shown in large print on the homepage of their 
            websites. This could also be a huge selling point for the website’s services, as users want privacy and a secure online presence, 
            which will allow them to continue with their business life or personal life. We also see ethical user experience in the structure 
            of how information is presented to the user at one given time, as spoken about in the previous paragraph. Part of the reason why 
            this is considered ethical is because of how often we use digital tools and websites. Digital tools have almost become a part of 
            our everyday lives on a more personal level (Mok, 2023). Hence, because we have adapted into our everyday lives, it requires the 
            same ethical treatment as our usual everyday lives, such as respecting other people’s privacy in real life. While navigating the 
            Gandi.net website, I felt like they weren’t forcing me to sign up for their services; it was rather suggesting options that would 
            interest me, such as getting a domain name. The website also asks for user feedback so that it can improve the user experience of 
            the website. This is ethical practice as it cares about the user and what they like needs to change. It also shows that the website 
            doesn’t hide behind a closed door once the website is active. Therefore, ethical practices on the web have been demonstrated on the 
            Gandi.net website as it doesn’t force user decisions and keeps information private about the user, which creates an overall good and 
            ethical website.</p>
        <p>
        <p>We can conclude from the analyses of the Gandi.net website that it is important for websites to provide clean and friendly user 
            experiences and interfaces. We have seen this through the demonstration of a responsive layout combined with meaningful and calm 
            visual cues. These visual cues have been seen in the navigation system of the website and in how the website displays its 
            information sparingly. This analysis of the Gandi.net website has taught us about the importance of protecting users’ rights and 
            privacy by offering safety and privacy services on the web, such as secure domains. Therefore, web interactions are structured 
            through ethical user interface, and user experience is important for the website and the users as it makes the user feel seen.</p>
